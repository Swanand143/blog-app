        "My name is Lindsay Guarnieri and I live in the museum center of the United States- Washington DC. I am a student in the MA Museum studies program at George Washington University. I also hold a BA in Film Studies and Cultural Anthropology from Mount Holyoke College. I have a deep love for cultural museums as well as museums that explore the film industry, the art of film, and art museums that incorporate film into their exhibitions. I also love baking, cooking, reading, and hanging out with friends.",

        "Social media is something I believe can be amazing for helping people build community, however I also view it as one of the biggest issues facing young girls. As young girls grow up, they are constantly seeking validation from their peers, friends, family, and anyone else in their life. Now, with social media this also includes the rest of the world. This has resulted in many young girls having severe mental health issues that were not as prevalent for earlier generations who did not have social media growing up. However, it is also a place where many girls can show off their creativity, connect with others who share similar interests and hobbies, and a place where they can find joy in sharing things with friends. I believe that teaching young girls the importance of boundaries when it comes to social media and to explain how social media works can help in aiding them to understand the unrealistic standards that social media puts and how they can use social media in a way that is not damaging to their mental health.",

        "Because of their brilliant result, they are ascending in their category, which means they will have to play in larger pitches and with 11 a side (before it was 9 to 9) (Moses, 2024). Even if the change in conditions affects their future performance, for better or worse, this achievement cannot be erased. More than that, what comes through while reading about them are two things: the outside belief from their coach and manager in their capacities, but more importantly, their self belief. By training hard and through teamwork (some of them have played together for several years), they already see themselves as examples for other girls to pick up the sport. As Edith, one of the defenders, mentions, they believed in themselves even when they were underestimated or mocked (Coombes, 2024)..",

        "In The Politics and Poetics of Transgression, Peter Stallybrass and Allon White note that groups that have very little social or political power often have a great deal of symbolic power. This is what interests me about girlhood. While actual girls have little to no voice in shaping their worlds, the ideal of white girlhood has played an outsized role in political debates in the US, especially debates around race, gender, and sexuality. And, in turn, these political debates in which girls are both central and voiceless, have shaped girls’ lives. ",

        "Abstract: In the 1970s, child actress and model Brooke Shields became a flashpoint for the crisis over child sexuality and paedophilia. Shields’s disturbing marriage of a child’s body with a womanly face disrupted the iconography of childhood that had flourished since the Enlightenment and pointed towards a new paradigm that has become more prominent in the decades since. This article examines how child liberationist views that children are sexual beings helped to shape Shields’s public image as an object of adult male desire, even as her celebrity became a vector for the emerging feminist argument that children must be protected from adult desire. Through discourse about Shields, artists, journalists, and others articulated opposing logics for understanding the newly sexualised child and helped lay the foundation for contemporary debates about children in visual culture.",

        "In the tapestry of human history, the role of women in ancient civilizations is a thread woven with complexity, diversity, and resilience. Across the vast expanse of time and geography, women in various ancient cultures played pivotal roles, contributing to the cultural, social, and economic fabric of their societies. This article aims to delve into the societal roles, rights, and contributions of women in selected ancient civilizations, shedding light on the rich and varied experiences of women in the ancient world. ",

        "The study of women in ancient civilizations reveals a spectrum of experiences, from the constraints imposed by patriarchal norms to instances of empowerment and influence. The roles, rights, and contributions of women in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and the Indus Valley Civilization paint a diverse picture of resilience, creativity, and societal impact. As we navigate the complexities of the past, we glean valuable lessons for fostering gender equality and acknowledging the enduring contributions of women across the ages.",

        "Dame Laura Knight is rightly recognised as one of the most successful and historically significant English painters of all time. She enjoyed a hugely successful career which paved the way for greater recognition and celebration of the talent of fellow female artists in the male-dominated British art establishment. She also found great interest and inspiration in marginalised communities, such as gypsies, circus performers and travellers. In 1936, she became the first woman elected full membership of the Royal Academy. Her large retrospective there in 1965 was the first for a woman. ",

The resulting body of work highlighted the plight of the ordinary rural people, many of whom were on the brink of starvation, and prompted the government to come to their aid. Lange’s deeply effecting work during this period has come to define the Depression era ",

          "International cooperation on digital technology has focused on technical and infrastructural issues and the digital economy, often at the expense of how technological developments were affecting society and generating disruption across all its layers – especially for the most vulnerable and historically excluded. There is a global governance deficit in addressing the challenges and risks of AI and harnessing its potential to leave no one behind. ",

          "In the current AI architecture, benefits and risks are not equitably distributed, with power concentrated in the hands of a few corporations, States and individuals, who control talent, data and computer resources. There is also no mechanism to look at broader considerations, like new forms of social vulnerability generated by AI, the disruption of industries and labour markets, the propensity for emerging technology to be used as a tool of oppression, the sustainability of the AI supply chain, or the impact of AI on future generations.",
